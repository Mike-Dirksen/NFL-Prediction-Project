# NFL-Prediction-Project
Research project using data analysis through pandas to analyze NFL player and team data

Topic Overveiw

The topic of this coding project will to create some sort of a predictive model for NFL match outcomes and individual player data. I am personally interested in NFL topics, and I see this as a branch of my passions and interests to create something with a use. I will use Pandas and other Python Libraries in order to make rolling trackers, and a suggestive model to project out future performance. I see this project as having applications past developing my skills with possible usages in my personal Fantasy Football and Sports Betting endeavors. 

Data Aquisition

I will be sourcing data from a multitude of websites depending on the specific metrics. Example sites I will attempt to scrape are: 'Pro Football Reference', 'ESPN', 'The Football Database', 'Kaggle', and for old betting data I will use 'Sports Betting History'. This data can be scraped off of the site using Requests + BeautifulSoup, and pandas.read_html for well structured sites. Additionally Kaggle has readily avalible .csv data to download. I may also decide to dabble in R to aquire live player data. 

Research Questions

The NFL is a well researched and dynamic game with many new inputs changing game-to-game and season-to-season, this will make live changes to player metrics difficult and possibly taxing. However, throughout this project I hope to answer: 
1. Which team is most likely to win a given matchup based on recent performance trends, injuries, and home-field advantage?
2. How does turnover margin correlate with win probability across the past 10 seasons?
3. Can we identify early-season player metrics that best predict end-of-season fantasy football success?
4. What statistical indicators best differentiate playoff teams from non-playoff teams?
5. Which teams tend to outperform betting spreads, and what common traits do they have?
6. Can we develop a rolling power ranking system that updates weekly based on team performance metrics and opponent strength?
7. Are there matchups or coaching schemes that consistently suppress specific player performances?
I will try to use this Analysis to make a good match and player predicitor for this upcoming season. I also want to see if I can understand the game on a deeper level through the analysis. Before it begins, I want to put together predictions for all matchups that will take place and final rankings. Even though I have an initial deadline of June 23rd for the project I see this extending well into the summer.
